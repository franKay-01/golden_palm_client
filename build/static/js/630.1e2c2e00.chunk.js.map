We appreciate your patience and understanding.\n      \n      Because our products are food-based, all sales are final. We do not accept returns or offer refunds.\n      \n      If your order arrives damaged or incorrect, please contact us within 5 days of delivery at hello@goldenpalmfoods.com with your order number and a photo.

It may solidify when cold and liquefy when warm—this is completely natural and does not affect quality.\n      \n      # Red Palm Oil: Keep tightly sealed in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight. Do not refrigerate, as it may affect the texture.\n      \n      # Peanut Oil: Store in a cool, dry place away from heat and light. Be sure to close the cap tightly after each use.\n      \n      # All-Purpose Spice Blend: Keep tightly sealed and store in a cool, dry pantry away from heat and sunlight.\n      \n      # Bambara Beans: Store in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.\n      \n      If you have any questions about a specific product, feel free to email us at hello@goldenpalmfoods.com\n      `\n    },\n    {\n      question: \"Where can I buy your products?\",\n      answer: `You can shop our full product line directly on our website.
